# Simple Aspect Ratio Calculator

Although this project was born on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/joontae93/pen/GRYoEgv), I spun this repo up to give myself a better dev experience while I work on new features and can then push it live again at the codepen.

Mostly, I built this because I wanted a simple CSS aspect-ratio calculator with styles (instead of browsers' stylesheets for input fields).
